# Deep Learning for Options Pricing

## Overview
This repository demonstrates the use of deep learning techniques, particularly Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), for predicting option prices. The model leverages historical market data to generate accurate pricing predictions, which can be applied to various financial instruments for risk management, portfolio optimization, and more.

## Features
- Data gathering and preprocessing
- Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model for option pricing
- Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model for sequential price prediction
- Hyperparameter tuning for model optimization
